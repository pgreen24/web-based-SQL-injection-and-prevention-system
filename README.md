# Web-Based SQL injection and prevention system

#### This system is designed to demonstrate the importance of preventing SQL injection attacks in web applications. It includes a login form that accepts user input and validates it against a database using PHP and MySQL.

# üíâwhat is SQL injection?
SQL Injection, is a type of web application security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It is a code injection technique that attackers can use to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications that use SQL as their database language.

## Checking Security for Web Application using Burp Suite and SQL Map</br>

## Burp Suite</br>

Burp Suite is a comprehensive toolkit for web application security testing. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use Burp Suite to check security for a web application:</br>

1.Install and configure Burp Suite: Download and install Burp Suite from the official website. Configure the proxy settings in your browser to point to Burp Suite.</br>
2.Scan the web application: Enter the URL of the web application in Burp Suite and start the scan. Burp Suite will crawl the website and identify potential vulnerabilities.</br>
3.Analyze the scan results: Review the scan results to identify potential vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).</br>
4.Exploit vulnerabilities: Use Burp Suite's exploitation tools to test the identified vulnerabilities and verify their existence.</br>

# SQL Map

SQL Map is an open-source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use SQL Map to check security for a web application:</br>

1.Install SQL Map: Download and install SQL Map from the official website.</br>
2.Identify potential injection points: Use SQL Map to identify potential injection points in the web application, such as user input fields.</br>
3.Scan for SQL injection: Use SQL Map to scan the identified injection points for SQL injection vulnerabilities.</br>

##### Exploit SQL injection: Use SQL Map to exploit the identified SQL injection vulnerabilities and extract sensitive data.</br>
